        Depth Chart:
            - Given 48 minutes at each of the 5 standard positions, distribute those minutes among each player
            For instance, if I want a player to split time at SG and SF, they might have 15 minutes at each,
            which might show up as a bar with two different colored segments, etc.
            - Sortable by depth chart position / number of total minutes
            - Option to automatically decide lineups

--- GAME ---
    Set Opposition Instructions
    During gameplay: Call timeout when you have the ball
    Able to watch gamecast, with optional broadcasting
        Broadcasting: Play by Play and Color commentary
    At timeouts can adjust lineup, make tactical changes
    Sideline tactical changes?
    Injured player updates

    When the game ends: produce a Result object
        - record all stats and other applicable data

--- GAME SIMULATOR ENGINE ---
    - Divided into Possessions
    - Each possession divided into Events
    - Each possession will have different attributes determined by:
        - Time left
        - Coach style
        - Strategy
        - Personnel
        - Situation
    - For example, increase pace when down by more than 10
        - Decrease pace if you're turning the ball over a lot

--- EITHER
    - Possessions branch into different Events
        - Ex. 'Normal Halfcourt Setup' -> 'SG Iso' -> 'Drive' -> 'Layup' -> 'Rebound' -> 'END'
            - 1. Bring the ball up the court, set up halfcourt offense in about 5-8 secs
            - 2. SG isolates, other players space the floor. May involve dribble moves and other actions.
            - 3. SG sees opening and drives (at this point, can pass to open teammate or commit to shot)
            - 4. Layup success is determined by defenders, player skill, etc.
            - 5. Rebounders' attributes are weighed against each other to determine who gets the ball
            - 6. Defensive player secured the rebound.
            - 7. End of possession, record all relevant stats and move on to the next possession.
        - Tons of variables.... for instance Iso might look totally different if you have a big man who can shoot 3's
            (will be out at the perimeter) or one that plays in the post (will be near the basket)
        - Plays can have multiple participants, not just ball-handler and their defender

--- OR (I like this more)
    - Each player on offense has offensive responsibilities
    - When they don't have the ball, they will do what their responsibilities dictate
        - Set screens, get open, post up, spot up, etc.
        - Responsibilities complement each other
            - Set screens for players trying to get open
        - Responsibilities have locations associated with them
    - The ball handler will look for opportunities to get the ball to teammates or score, depending on tendencies/openings
    - Defenders react to the ball and their marks
    - Behaviors strongly influenced by tendencies and strategy

--- Teams
    - Players keep track of team ID
    - Team has roster which contains player ID's

--- Player Creation
    - Process:
        - Pick template
        - run attributes through normal distribution
        - equations (x = age)
            - fund = -.0022526*x2 + .145624*x - 1.327448
            - ath = -.0021103*x2 + .0981017*x - .1806373
            - IQ = -.00170189*x2 + .1247555*x - 1.273465
        - Answer is factor to multiply attribute by

--- MISC
    - WEIGHT and ATHLETICISM
        - System that defines relationship between weight and athleticism
        - Baseline values given to each player (in template?)
        - If a player is out of shape, they can gain weight and be less athletic
        - If a player is strength training, they can gain weight and strength, might lose athleticism
        - Can do aerobic training to lose weight and gain athleticism back

    - DRAFT AI
        - Should prioritize in order:
            1. Athleticism
            2. Size
            3. Current Ability
            4. Success
        - Take more risks in later rounds

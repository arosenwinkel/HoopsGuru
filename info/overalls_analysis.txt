This is what each player's normalized overall should be based on
their Value Over Replacement Player (only considering players w/ 
>500 minutes).

This is based on a scale in which the best player in the league is
rated a 90 (gives us some wiggle room) and the lowest is rated a 
10 (again, wiggle room).
